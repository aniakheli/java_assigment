# Array # 

an array is a data structure that stores a collection of values of the same type . we access each individual values through an integer index. for example, if  a is an array of integers, then a[i] is the ith integer in the array.
## declare an array ##
type
an array variable by specifying the array type - which is the element type followed by[] -and the array variable name. 
###synax:###
int[] a;
however ,this statement only declare the variable *a*.it does not yet **initialize** *a* with the actual array . use the *new* operator to create the array.
int [i] a.**new** int[100];
* this statement declare and initialized an array of 100 integers.

1.2 ## type of array ##
There are two types of array.

1.   Single Dimensional Array
2.    Multidimensional Array

1.2 ## The "for each" lopp ##
      java has a powerful looping construct that allows you to loop through each element in an array without having to fuss with index values.
        The *enchanced* for loop
          for(*variable* : *collection*) *statement* 
          
 set the given variable to each element of the collection and then executes the statement. the *collection* expression must be an array or an object of the class that implement the **ITERABLE**   interface .such as **Arraylist**.
