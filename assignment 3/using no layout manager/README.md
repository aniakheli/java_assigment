# using no layout manager #


Although it is possible to do without a layout manager, we should use a layout manager if at all possible.
A layout manager makes it easier to adjust to look-and-feel-dependent component appearances, to different font sizes, to a container's changing size, and to different locales. 
Layout managers also can be reused easily by other containers, as well as other programs.
